# 🖩 Calculator 

I have created a calculator app using React. I have also ensured that this application takes care of commas (e.g. 12,000). I have also taken care of periods(.) and zeroes when nothing is entered in the calculator.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Used 

**Tool:** VS Code, npm

**Programming Language:** React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML
